# Qwen YouTube Transcript Summarizer

This notebook extracts transcripts from YouTube videos, restores punctuation, and generates summaries using the **Qwen-1.8B Chat** model from Alibaba, running through Hugging Face Transformers.

## What It Does

- Extracts YouTube transcript (if available)
- Adds punctuation using [`rpunct`](https://github.com/babthamotharan/rpunct)
- Generates a summary using Qwen via Hugging Face
- Works in **Google Colab** or **locally**

## Important Notes

> **YouTube may rate-limit or block transcript requests when running in Colab or other cloud environments.**

If this happens:
- Youâ€™ll get an error like: `RequestBlocked`
- Workaround: **run the notebook locally** or **upload a transcript file manually**
